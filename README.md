Modelsim_SEE_Inject
===================

A tcl extension to simulate Single Event Effects (SEEs) in Modelsim

The tcl tool can be started when testbench and VHDL files are compiled in Modelsim.
The simulation can be set up over a Tk GUI and then upsets and transients can be simulated.

An example project will be added.
